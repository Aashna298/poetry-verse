# poetry verse

this is a personal project I made to combine two things I love - beautiful poetry and learning web development.
I recently started learning HTML and wanted to create something meaningful while practicing. 
So, I built this small collection of shayeri from poets I admire,like Ahmad Faraz, parveen shakir,Faiz ahmad Faiz,and others
It's simple,but it's special to me


## what's in it

-HTML and CSS for structure and styling
-shayeri text images of poets
-Audio files for a more immersive feel

## why i made it

I love shayeri,and i wanted my first HTML project to reflect something I care about.
Its not perfect- but its mine and i'm proud of it

made with love
